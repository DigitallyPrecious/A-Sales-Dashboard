# A-Sales-Dashboard
I created a dashboard containing a sales report for a hypothetical business using MS Excel. The Sales Dashboard is designed to provide a hypothetical business owner with a comprehensive overview of their annual business activities. It offers insights into sold items, order dates, regional sales, unit costs, and sales representatives' performance over a year. Its features include visualization of sales patterns according to different regions, items, order dates, sales representatives, and regional sales. To interact with the dashboard, ensure you have Microsoft Excel installed on your device. The data used in this dashboard is hypothetically generated for the purpose of this self-project.
